You will be given a number 'N' and a list of N distinct integers. 
Your task is to print a sequence containing these N distinct integers such that the absolute difference between the 
adjacent elements in the sequence is minimum out of all possible sequences. If there are multiple sequences that satisfy the given condition then
print the lexigraphically largest sequence among them.

Input :
The first line of your input will be the number N.
The second line of your input consists a list of N distinct integers.

Output :
print the lexigraphically largest sequence out of all the sequences that satisfy the given condition.
