You will be given a integer N. you will be given a binary string "S" of length N.
Your task is to find the total number of binary strings of length N that can be selected such that 
the decimal value of ( given binary string | selected binary string ) is equal to 
power(2,N-1).

Here ' | ' represents the bitwise OR operation.

Input :
The first line of your input will be a integer denoting the size of the binary string N.
The second line of your input will be the binary string of length N.

Output :
Print the total number of binary strings of length N that can be selected such that 
the decimal value of ( given binary string | selected binary string ) is equal to 
power(2,N-1).
