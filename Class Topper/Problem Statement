In a class of n students, each student has marks in 6 subjects. The marks of each student are provided as space-separated values, where the 
i-th line represents the marks of the i-th student (with roll number i). Write a program to output the top 3 students who scored the highest, along with their total marks. 
If there are multiple students with the same total marks among the top 3, print them in ascending order of their roll numbers.

Input :
The first line contains an integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 100), the number of students.
The next n lines contain 6 space-separated integers, where each integer represents the marks of a student in each of the 6 subjects.

Output:
Output the roll numbers of the top 3 students with the highest total marks.
For each of the top 3 students, output their roll number and their total marks.
If there are multiple students with the same total marks, output them in ascending order of their roll numbers.
