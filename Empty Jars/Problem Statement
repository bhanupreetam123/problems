Hemanth has N jars filled with various number of candies in each jar. Initially he has to select a value x (x is a positive integer).
In one operation , hemanth can select any jar and distribute EXACTLY x number of candies to his friends from that jar.
(Note that once the 'x' value is selected ,it cannot be changed for another opreation. It is constant for all operations)
Hemanth has a very kind heart and he wants to give all the candies to his friends (emptying every jar). But hemanth is a lazy person, so
he wants this job done in the minimum number of operations possible. Help hemanth to find the value of 'x' to achieve his goal.

Input :
The first line of input will be an integer N representing the number of jars hemanth has.
The second line of input consists a list of size N where the i'th value represents the number of candies in the i'th jar.

Output :
Help Hemanth find the most optimal value of 'x' to achieve his goal.
